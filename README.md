### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cassia!

I am rising second year grad student in [Physical Oceanography](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/story/Physical_Oceanography) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) under the guidance of [LuAnne Thompson](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/LuAnne_Thompson). I'm currently working towards my MS in [Applied Mathematics](https://amath.washington.edu/) and M.S. in Oceanography. I graduated from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in June 2021 in [Earth & Planetary Sciences](https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/).

I am interested in continuing to explore climate science, data science, and data visualization. I'm currently studying marine heatwaves!
