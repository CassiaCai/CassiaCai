### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cassia!

Iâ€™m a second-year physical oceanography PhD student in the [School of Oceanography](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where Iâ€™m advised by [LuAnne Thompson](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/LuAnne_Thompson). My research focuses on characterizing marine heatwaves.

Previously, I was advised by [Daniel Horton](https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/horton-daniel.html) in the [Climate Change Research Group](https://sites.northwestern.edu/danethan/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) (2018 to 2021) and by [Young-Oh Kwon](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/ykwon/) at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/?_gl=1*19rekmb*_ga*MTA1NTQ1NTQ0OS4xNjc1ODg2Nzg3*_ga_HLKFZX9JZK*MTY3ODMzODMwOS4zLjAuMTY3ODMzODMwOS4wLjAuMA..) (2020). I graduated in 2021 from Northwestern University, where I studied [Earth & Planetary Sciences](https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/) and [Physics](https://physics.northwestern.edu/).
