### Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Cassia!

I am first year PhD student in [Physical Oceanography](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/story/Physical_Oceanography) at the University of Washington under the guidance of [LuAnne Thompson](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/LuAnne_Thompson). I graduated from Northwestern University in June 2021 with majors in Earth & Planetary Sciences and Geography.

I am interested in continuing to explore climate science. I'm currently studying marine heatwaves!
