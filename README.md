### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cassia!

Iâ€™m a second-year physical oceanography PhD student in the [School of Oceanography](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where Iâ€™m advised by [LuAnne Thompson](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/LuAnne_Thompson). My research focuses on characterizing marine heatwaves.
